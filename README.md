## Problem Statement
Given two arrays of geographic coordinates, match each point in the first array to the closest point in the second array.

## Solutions

### 1. Naive Approach
- Iterate through each point in array A.
- For each point in A, calculate the distance to every point in array B.
- Return an array containing the closest point in B for each point in A.

### 2. Improved Approach: KD Tree
- Construct a KD Tree using array B to reduce the number of distance calculations.
- Perform a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) query on the tree to identify the closest points.
- Use longitude and latitude for the KD Tree queries, followed by the distance formula for final validation.

### Resources
The KD Tree implementation was found on geeksforgeeks and KNN query was inspired by StableSortâ€™s video tutorial and code.

GPT used to create some base test cases.
